# Widgets for students, leveraging popular services and their data

StuduWidgts is an iOS native app built to make student life go more smoothly. StuduWidgets make it easy to absorbe everyday information by presenting things such as timetable on your Home Screen with a Widget. 

## Why

We, as highschool students find it hard to manage and get quick answers to questions like:
- what subject do we have next period?
- where is that next period?
- how long will this period last? I wanna go home
- what will be for lunch today?
- are my lunches all ordered for next week?
